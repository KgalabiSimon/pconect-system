## Current Version: 87 ✅ DEPLOYED - CAMERA FIXED
Visitor Kiosk - Black Screen Issue Resolved

🌐 **Live at:** https://same-k1aagq7et6e-latest.netlify.app
📱 **Visitor Kiosk:** https://same-k1aagq7et6e-latest.netlify.app/kiosk/visitors/register
🔐 **Admin Portal:** https://same-k1aagq7et6e-latest.netlify.app/admin/login

✅ **Status:** Camera Black Screen FIXED - Ready to Test
📸 **Camera:** Enhanced with proper video loading
🎯 **Testing:** Open console (F12) to see debug logs

## Version 87 Updates ⭐ CAMERA BLACK SCREEN FIXED

### 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

**Root Cause:** Video element wasn't fully ready when capturing photo, resulting in black canvas

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **✅ Added 500ms Delay After Video Loads**
   - Waits for video metadata to load
   - Additional 500ms delay ensures first frame is available
   - Prevents capturing before video stream is ready

2. **✅ Enhanced Video Ready Checks**
   - Checks `video.readyState` (must be >= 2)
   - Validates `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` are not 0
   - Alerts user if video not ready instead of capturing black screen

3. **✅ Better Error Handling**
   - Added `NotReadableError` handling (camera in use by another app)
   - Clear error messages for each failure type
   - Console logging for debugging

4. **✅ Proper Video Stream Management**
   - Properly stops existing streams before starting new one
   - Sets streamRef to null after stopping
   - Awaits video play() promise

5. **✅ Canvas Improvements**
   - Clears canvas before drawing
   - Mirrors image in canvas (not just video display)
   - High quality JPEG (0.95 quality)
   - Proper dimension setting

6. **✅ Visual Enhancements**
   - Added green "✓ Camera Ready" indicator at top
   - Larger capture button (h-16, green background)
   - Better positioning guide

### 📊 **Technical Details:**

**Camera Initialization Flow:**
```typescript
1. Stop existing stream (if any)
2. Request getUserMedia with constraints
3. Attach stream to video element
4. Wait for 'loadedmetadata' event
5. Play video
6. Wait additional 500ms for first frame
7. Show camera UI
8. Display "Camera Ready" indicator
```

**Capture Validation:**
```typescript
1. Check video.readyState >= 2 (HAVE_CURRENT_DATA)
2. Check videoWidth > 0 and videoHeight > 0
3. Set canvas dimensions to match video
4. Clear canvas
5. Draw video frame (with mirroring)
6. Convert to blob (JPEG 0.95 quality)
7. Create object URL
8. Save to form data
```

### 🧪 **How to Test:**

**Step 1: Open Developer Console**
- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
- Go to Console tab
- Keep it open during testing

**Step 2: Navigate to Visitor Kiosk**
- URL: https://same-k1aagq7et6e-latest.netlify.app/kiosk/visitors/register

**Step 3: Fill Form to Step 4**
- Step 1: Select employee or "Other"
- Step 2: Skip location
- Step 3: Enter details (phone: 0821234567)
- Step 4: Camera testing

**Step 4: Test Camera**
1. Click "Take Photo" button
2. **Allow camera permission** when prompted
3. **Watch console logs:**
   ```
   📸 Requesting camera access...
   ✅ Camera access granted
   Stream active: true
   Video tracks: 1
   ✅ Video metadata loaded
   Video dimensions: 1280 x 720
   ✅ Video is playing
   Video readyState: 4
   ```
4. **You should see:**
   - Your face in the video (mirrored)
   - Green "✓ Camera Ready" badge at top
   - "Position your face in frame" at bottom
5. Click green "Capture Photo" button
6. **Watch console logs:**
   ```
   📸 Attempting to capture photo...
   Video readyState: 4
   Video dimensions: 1280 x 720
   Video paused: false
   Canvas dimensions set to: 1280 x 720
   ✅ Image drawn to canvas
   ✅ Blob created, size: XXXXX bytes
   ✅ Photo captured successfully
   ```
7. **Photo should appear** (not black!)
8. Can click "Retake Photo" to test again

### 🐛 **If You Still See Black Screen:**

**Check Console Logs:**

**Good Logs (Working):**
```
✅ Video is playing
Video readyState: 4
Video dimensions: 1280 x 720
✅ Photo captured successfully
```

**Bad Logs (Issues):**
```
❌ Video not ready. ReadyState: 0 or 1
❌ Video has no dimensions
❌ Failed to create blob
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Video not ready"** → Wait longer, try again
2. **"Video has no dimensions"** → Close and reopen camera
3. **"Camera already in use"** → Close other apps using camera
4. **Permission denied** → Allow camera in browser settings

### 📸 **Debug Console Commands:**

If you want to manually check video status, open console and type:

```javascript
// Check if video is ready
const video = document.querySelector('video');
console.log('ReadyState:', video.readyState);
console.log('Dimensions:', video.videoWidth, 'x', video.videoHeight);
console.log('Paused:', video.paused);
```

**Issue**: Scanner made beep sound but modal didn't open
**Cause**: sessionStorage is isolated per login session - security officer couldn't access user's data
**Solution**: Store check-in data in localStorage which is shared across all sessions
**Result**: Modal now opens correctly with all user information displayed!
