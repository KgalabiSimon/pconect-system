    "P-Conect is a cloud-based workplace platform that unifies people flow, attendance, and space utilization. QR-based check-in/out captures accurate presence data without hardware hassles, delivering instant visibility of who is on-site, when, and where. The hot-desking module lets employees reserve desks or rooms in advance or on arrival, with rules for teams, zones, and capacitiesâ€”reducing congestion and improving space efficiency. Administrators manage everything from a secure web console: roles and permissions, site policies, notifications, and detailed reports for payroll and compliance. Built with a mobile-first experience and open APIs, P-Conect is designed to plug into Microsoft 365/Entra ID and building systems, supporting government departments, multi-tenant offices, and education campuses that need dependable, auditable occupancy and productivity insight.",
